From a dataset consisting of the health information, we created models predicting if patients suffer coronary artery disease. The next step was, using XAI methods, analyzing the model's decisions
about particular patients as like importance of variables in the whole model.
The result of this project was a chapter of a book about case studies in machine learning:
