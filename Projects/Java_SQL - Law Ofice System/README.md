# DuraLEX - management system for law firm

## View of project
The point of this project was to create a system allowing law firm managing their clients and cases. For that reason, I created a database (file DBCreate.sql) and Java program that connects to DB and allows to receive information and change records. Users can perform actions like: 
- see all clients, cases, or meetings
- add new information
- change clients data
- get report about client
- delete client

### All clients info
